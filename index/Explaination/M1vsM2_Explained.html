      <h1>What are Modals (M)</h1>
      <p>
        Within the laraynx there are three mechanisms that can affect how the vocal folds vibrate and produce sound. These affect how your 
        voice sounds and can create different "qualities" in the voice. These are often refered to as M0 (voal fry), M1 
        (chest voice, sometimes called your speaking voice) and M2 (head voice, sometimse called falsetto). Of these the 
        most notable shift people are familiar with is the shiften between M1 (chest voice) and M2 (head voice). This is

      <h1>M0</h1>
      <p>
        M0 is the lowest of the three modals and is often referred to as vocal fry due to many accidentally slipping into this modal when
        attempting to lower the pitch of their voice beyond their natural range without proper training. This voice is often described
        as creaky, rough or gravelly and is often used in voice acting to create a voice that is more sinister, mysterious, creepy or
        to help achieve some of that "smoker" voice quality. During this both the body and the cover of the vocal folds are loose.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h1>M1</h1>
      <p>
        M1 is the middle modal and is often referred to as teh chest voice. This is the voice that most people use when speaking and is
        the voice that is most commonly used in day to day life. This voice is often described as being rich, full and warm and is often or mixed.
        While it's often used for speaking it is also commonly used in singing and voice acting. During the mode both the body and cover of the vocal folds vibrate.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h1>M2</h1>
      <p>
        M2 is often referred to as the head voice and is the highest of the three modals. This voice is often described as being light, airy, bright and sometimes even cartoonish.
        This voice is often used in singing and voice acting to create a voice that is more whimsical, childlike or to help achieve some of that "anime" voice quality. 
        During this mode only the cover of the vocal folds vibrate. This voice is often entered by accident when trying to reach a higher note without proper training.
        While it's possible to learn how to speak and sing in this modal while sounding natural; it takes a lot of practice and training to do so, often requiring the help of an experienced vocal coach.
