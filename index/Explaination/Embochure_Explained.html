      <h1>Embouchure</h1>
      <p>
        In the context of speaking, the embouchure refers to the way in which
        the lips, mouth and facial muscles are used to shape and produce sound.
        While the term is often used in relation to wind insturments it can also
        be used in speaking and voice acting, impacting how the voice sounds as
        we comminicate. A more controlled embouchure can help to enunciate more
        with clear sounds and words however it can also have an affect on the
        voice useful for the purpose of voice acting.

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Large Embochure</h1>
      <p>
        A lareg embochure involves a broader mouth opening and more relaxes lip
        positioning. This resuts in a fuller sound and enhances vocal
        projection. however the openess can also all more air to escape making a
        more breathy voice. It is imporatant to note that breathy is not always
        a bad thing but is not the same thing as an open quotient. A large
        embochure can also give a sensation of "size" to the voice, making it
        sound larger or from a larger character.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can hear the effect of a large embochure in some actors or
        characters to include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>James Earl Jones</li>
        <li>Patrick Stewart</li>
        <li>Idris Elba</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- Third Content -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Small Embocure</h1>
      <p>
        Through the narrowing of the embochure with a smaller mouth opening and
        more tense lip position, a voice can sound more crisp, focused or
        brighter. This can come accross more "consentrated", or "sharp". This is
        another effect often used in the voiceacting of children, women and
        characters that are trying to be portrayed as "small" or "cute". Often
        this is can be heard in various cartoons and anime where voice actors
        are attempting to portray younger characters.
