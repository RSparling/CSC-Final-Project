      <h1>What is Quotient?</h1>
      <p>
        An individual's quotient is a persons voice is the ratio of the length of the vocal folds to the length of the vocal tract. So, 
        this is a fancy phrasing so what does this really mean?W hen speaking an individuals vocal folds vibrate and whether they are open
        or closed will affect how the sound they produce sounds. What this sounds like is often described as the voice being "breathy", "clear" 
        or "bright" when the folds are more open or "pressed" or "dark" when the folds are more closed. This can often be heard in the difference between the voice
        of a child and an adult. As an adult the vocal folds become longer and thicker to various degrees and causes the voice to sound deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it's imporant to note that a more or less open quotient does not necessarly mean that a voice is deeper or higher pitched. It is possible to have
        a voice with a low pitch but a very open quoitent or a voice with a high pitched voice and a very closed quotient. This is because the pitch of a voice is
        affected and determined by a large number of factors.

      <h1>Examples of Closed Coquient Voices</h1>
      <p>
        In popular media there are a variety of close quotient voices that one can draw from, though it can be best thought of any character with a Lower
        speaking voice that tends to come accross more "dark", or "intimidating".

      <p>
        Some Examples are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>James Earl Jones as Darth Vader</li>
        <li>Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry</li>
        <li>Tom Waits as Himself</li>
        <li>Sam Elliot as Himself</li>
        <li>Mark Sheppard as Crowley</li>

      <h1>Examples of Open Quotient Voices</h1>
      <p>
        Open quotient voices, which are usually described as "light", "bright" or "breathy" are often associated with characters that are more "innocent" or "youthful" or
        more flamboyant. These can often be seen in children or child like characters.
