      <h1>What is the Laranyx?</h1>
      <p>
        The Laranyx is a part of the human body that is responsible for producing sound. It is located in the throat and is often referred to as the "voice box". 
        The Laranyx is made up of cartilage and muscles that work together to produce sound. When you speak or sing, air from your lungs passes through the Laranyx, 
        causing the vocal cords to vibrate and produce sound. The sound is then shaped by the mouth, nose, and throat to create speech or singing.

      However where this comes in use is when attempting to shorten or lengthn the vocal tract. This can be done by raising or lowering the Laranyx. 
        When the Laranyx is raised, the vocal tract is shortened, which can result in a higher resonance. When the Laranyx is lowered, the vocal tract is lengthened, 
        which can result in a lower pitch. This is why the Laranyx is often referred to as the "voice box" because it plays a key role in producing sound.

        It is important to note that while lowering and raising the laranyx can have an affect on the voice as a whole and, notably, the perception of pitch it is does not directly
        affect the pitch of the voice. Rather the perceived raise in pitch is either from the speaker or singing failing to properly control their pitch while raising the laranyx or
        as a consequence of the increased resonance. The opposite is also true when lowering the laranyx. Any perceived lowering of pitch is either from the speaker or singer failing
        to properly control their pitch while lowering the laranyx or as a consequence of the decreased resonance. It is, in essence, either poor control or a auditory illusion.
