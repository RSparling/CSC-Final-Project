      <h1>Yawning</h1>
      <p>
        The yawning drill uses the mechanism of yawning to help familiarize
        oneself with the sensation of lowering the larynx and how the various
        muscles that manipulate it move it downward.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Preform This Drill</h2>
      <p>
        First yawn and hold your muscles in place. Feel where your laranyx
        (adams apple) is located with your hand. Feel wheat muscles are relaxed
        and what musles are tense, causing it to be in this lowered state. Now,
        yawn onces more, keeping your laranyx in place as you vocalize or sing a
        line or two. The piece that you practices should while lowering your
        larynx in this way should not be long.
      </p>
      <h2>A Note About This Drill</h2>
      <p>
        This drill can be straining and damaging to your voice if done to often
        and repeatedly. It's only intended to teach you how to recognize what is
        being moved and causing the laranyx to lower. For safer, more long term
        practice instead look toward the small dog/big dog drill.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Small Dog/Big Dog</h1>
      <p>
        The "Small Dog/Big Dog drill" is similar to the "Big Dog/Small Dog drill
        used to practice raising the layrnx with the only key difference being
        the order of the pants and direction you work towards. This drill
        consists of three parts. The Pant, the vocalization and the phonation.
      </p>
      <h2>Panting</h2>
      <p>
        Start with making a panting sound at your base speaking volume. Feel how
        open your quotient is and how there is almost no vibration from your
        vocal cords. For this part, pant three times with the first two pants
        being the same pitch and the last pant being lower. Continue this until
        you reach the limit of what you cacn do in two to three cycles and then
        proceed to the vocalization test.
      </p>
      <h2>Vocalization</h2>
      <p>
        The vocaliztaion portion is the simplest part of the exercise and simply
        requires holding as low of a note as you can without raising your larynx
        or vocal fry. Hold it for two to three seconds and then proceed with the
        Phonation Test.
      </p>
      <h2>Vocalization Test</h2>
      <p>
        The vocalization portion of the "Small Dog/Big Dog" exercise is exactly
        the same as "Big Dog/ Small Dog" save for the difference of working with
        a a lowered laranyx and attempting to maintain it instead of a raised
        laranyx. Select a short passage or a few lines from a song and attempt
        to read or sing it aloud while maintaining the lowered laranyx.
