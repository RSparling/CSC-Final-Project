      <h1>The 'ee-oo' Drill</h1>
      <p>
        The 'ee-oo' is a simple drill that exploits the natural manner in which
        most people attempt to pronounce the vowel sounds 'ee' and 'oo'. The
        'ee' sound is produced by raising the back of the tongue and the 'oo'
        sound is produced by lowering the back of the tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, make the 'ee' sound like in the word 'see'. Notice how the back
        of the tongue raises. Next, make the 'oo' sound like in the word 'boo'.
        Notice how the back of the tongue lowerrs and the mouth opens up and
        enlarges. Having these two shape in mind, try to make the 'ee' sound
        while keeping your mouth liek for the 'oo' sound. Make sure to try to
        shift away from the 'oo' shape as little as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another things that you can do is maintain the 'ee' or 'oo' sound while
        moving the shape of your lips, changing lip tightness, moving your jaw
        and moving your tongue. The purpose of this is to explore the parameters
        you have to affect the sounds your make.

      <h1>The Plosive/Fricitive Drill</h1>
      <p>
        The Plosive/Fricitive Drill is a simple drill that allows you to explore
        the effect of changing the embrachure on the sound produced. This is
        done via using constant soudns and chagnging the shape of the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        First make a 'p' sound like in the word 'pop'. Notice how the lips come
        together, how tight they are when you make the sound, the force of the
        air inside the mouth. Next, make a 'f' sound like in the word 'fog'.
        Focus on the effect the lips, how tightly you press you teeth against
        your lips, and how your tongue is positioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then play with these two sounds, change any aspect or parameter of your
        mouth you can think of. Lip tighness, how raised or lowered the tongue
        is, how far forward or back the tongue is and how it moves as your
        produce a sound.
