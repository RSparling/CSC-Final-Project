      <h1>Closed Quotient Drill</h1>
      <p>
        Closing the vocal folds is a key part of speaking and singing but can be
        difficult to constrol and coordinate. This drill is desgined to be
        simple and easy to follow to help you practice the closing of the vocal
        folds. And the easiest way to show the difference between a more open
        and closed quotient is to use the word "uh-oh". When you say "uh" the
        vocal folds are more open and when you say "oh" the vocal folds are more
        closed. While the mouth is used to help shape the sound it does so
        minimially and largely relies on the vocal folds.

      <h1>How to Preform the Drill</h1>
      <p>
        To preform this drill, start by saying "uh-oh", paying careful attenting
        to the sound and sensation that occurs wen you switch between the two
        sounds. Try to make the "uh" sound as open as possible and the "oh"
        sound as closed as possible. You can also try to hold the "oh" sound for
        as long as possible to help build strength and control in the vocal
        folds. The voice is, after all, a series of different muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a good grasp on teh difference you can start attempting to
        incorporation pitch control into the drill as this will challenge your
        ability to control the the quotient of your vocal folds. During this
        exercise it is important to work in both directions, both trying to
        lower the pitch of "uh" and raising the pitch of "oh".

      <h1>Sirening</h1>
      <p>
        Sirening is the act of sliding between two notes rather than jumping
        between them. However it can also be used in practicing to control vocal
        quotient by sliding between an open and closed quotient. This can be
        done by starting at an open quotient and sliding into a more closed
        quotient such as sliding from "uh" to "oh".
