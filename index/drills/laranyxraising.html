    <h1>Big Dog/Small Dog</h1>
    <p>
      The big dog/small dog exercise is based around exploiting a tendancy on
      how a person often tries to make higher pitch sounds through a
      combination of raising their laraynx in conjuction to tightening their
      vocal folds.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Perform</h2>
    To practice the Big Down/Small Dog exercise first start with making a pant
    like that of a dog. It should be a breathy sound with very little
    vocalization to it and at roughly the same pitch as normally speak. Do
    this twice in quick succession followed by a higher third pant. When doing
    this you should feel your laranxy raise and the muscle connected to it
    tigthen. Once you feel that you cant get it as high as you can, you then
    move onto the vocalization portion.
    <h2>Vocalization</h2>
    <p>
      To preform the vocalization test and pracitce, simply hold a higher
      picture note and then move into speaking short passage or singing a few
      lyrics from a song that you wish to use to practice this quality.
