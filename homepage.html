      <h1>Our Goal</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of this website is to enable people to take control of their
        voice and equip them with the tools needed to train and refine it how
        they see fit.
      </p>

      <h1>How to Best Use this Site</h1>
      <p>
        This site is best used as a refrence for both learning about a vocal
        element and how to learn some basic ways to control that element. And
        while this has some openly available knowledge currated and distilled
        down to make it more digestable and easy to understand know that it's
        not an end-all-be-all. You should still look elsewhere to expand your
        repretoire of tools and techniques.
      </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h1>Tips for Effective Practice</h1>
        <p>
          When practicing you should make sure to keep a glass of water nearby.
          While many say warm water is prefered any water is fine so long as
          it's not ice water as that can cause your vocal cords to lose a bit of
          elasticity and make you more prone to injurty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, make sure to stop practicing if you experience any pain
          or moderate to severe discomfort. While your voice is a tool and
          instrument it is also a muscle (or a collection of them) and can be
          injured and even irrevercably damaged if pushed too far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, make sure to practice often. Studies show that smaller but
          more regular practice sessions help individuals to learn better than
          rarer but much longer sessions. Jusy taking 15 minutes out of your day
          makes a massive difference in the long run.
